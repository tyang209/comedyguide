<p>Hello. You're here because you want to do improv/sketch comedy in New York City! Well you're at the right place. New York City is big and there are lots of places where you can do that. This is a guide covering maybe 5% of the comedy scenes. Hell it doesn't even have any stand-up information. But this is all info I wish I had when I started so hopefully it helps you out.</p>
