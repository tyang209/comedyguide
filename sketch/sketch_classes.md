## UCB

### Signing up
Signing up for sketch classes at UCB is also incredibly competitive -- even more than improv because there are fewer classes -- but also check sold-out classes right before they start as people sometimes drop out.

**Sketch 101**
You write a bunch of sketches and you learn game.

**Sketch 201**
You write sketches and you learn how to rewrite sketches. You leave with a packet of sketches.

**Sketch 301**
You write sketches and learn how to put on a sketch show. Actors come in halfway through and you put on a show at the end.

### Advanced Study Writing
Just like improv you apply to Advanced Study Writing and pass or get rejected. If you get rejected don't fret, just take another 301. If you get in, congrats! Now you can apply to Maude, the house sketch teams at UCB. And also take the very occasional Advanced Study Writing class.
