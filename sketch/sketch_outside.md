## Indie Opportunities
**Word of Advice:** Sketch is a much bigger committment than improv. A monthly show typically takes meeting 10X*3 hours if you're a writer. Less if you're an actor. And that's not even counting the writing/rewriting. So if you want to do indie sketch you gotta commit or drop it.

### BoogieManja!
It's basically indie Maude Night. You get put on a team by applying with either a packet if you want to write or with a reel if you're an actor. Then your team does a show every 1.5 months. It is structured to be almost exactly like Maude Night. 

On average every show cycle you'll have:
* 1 pitch meeting
* 3 writer's meeting
* 1 table read
* 3 rehearsals
* 1 tech rehearsal
* 1 show.

#### Applying to Boogiemanja
Typically auditions are in the summer. 

Keep an eye out on the [website](http://www.boogiemanja.com/) and [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/boogiemanja/) for info.

### Doing your own thing.
Put on your own show. It's not as hard as it sounds. 

1. Gather a group of writer's and meet regularly. 
* BRING SKETCHES and REWRITE THEM. If you don't have content then you don't have a show. 
2. Hire a director. Find someone with experience. Contact someone who is a writer on Maude Night or get recommendations. This person should give constructive notes on your sketch.
3. Find a space for a show. The PIT theater is likely your best bet but you can put on a show anywhere.
4. Find a space to rehearse and rehearse your show. Your director should be here to so you can figure out blocking and line delivery.
5. ADVERTISE YOUR SHOW SO PEOPLE COME. It's a good show. Tell people about it.
6. Do the show.
