## UCB

### Signing up
Classes sell out quickly. Get Twitter notifications from [@UCBClassesNYC](https://twitter.com/UCBClassesNYC). You will need to be prepared to drop $450 in ten seconds so get that credit card ready.

### The classes.
The improv track at UCB crudely looks like this.

### Advanced Study?
After 401, your teacher will email you and tell you if you passed or failed through 401. Once you're told you've passed you can apply to Advanced Study. Check out this [link](https://newyork.ucbtrainingcenter.com/advanced) for more info about applying to advanced study.

*What if I don't pass or don't get into Advanced Study?*

Keep at it. Take another 401 or wait for a 410 class. 410 classes are typically about 4 week/1 show classes that are focused on something specific about scenework. After taking one of those, apply again.

**Okay I'm in. What now?**

Congrats. You are here forever. Advanced study comprises of two different types of classes.

1. **Advanced Study Harolds (ASHs)**

	These classes are typically picked through the lottery system, sometimes through teacher selection. And you can only take three per year. These classes typically focus on doing some flavor of the Harold or another form.

2. **Advanced Study Performances (ASPs)**

	These are like teacher pet projects. They're usually directing something they care about so they pick the class and it'll usually be something unique and fun. These classes get a short 1 month, 4 show run at the theater on Tuesday 11pm slot at UCB Chelsea. Check these shows out because you'll always see something unique.

**How long should I keep taking classes?**
Forever. Until you hate improv. You can continue taking classes for however long you want. If you want to audition for a Lloyd team though you will need to take at least one class a year to be eligible. 

### Diversity?
There is a lot more information on the [UCB Diversity Page](https://newyork.ucbtrainingcenter.com/diversity), but here is the gist of it. 

UCB has a diversity program that gives out scholarships to those who meet their criteria of being a diverse person in the comedy community. From their diversity page:

> We are looking to increase our diversity of
> * race and ethnicity
> * sexual orientation and gender identification
> * people over 40
> * individuals with disabilities
> * U.S. military service members or veterans

I highly recommend applying if you qualify. Applications open twice a year. They may or may not interview you for it. You not only get two free classes but you also don't have to rush to get into them. Credits however do not work on any classes that are teacher selected such as ASPs. 

They also offer two types of awards:

1. Diversity Scholarship
	You get two free credits for a six month period and can sign up for any class.

2. Diversity Fellowship
	You get to sign up for any two classes by using a credit but it is not free. It's the same as the scholarship minus the financial aid portion.

Sign up for the fellowship if you are diverse but do not have a financial hardship for taking classes. You should do this based on your financial situation. If you make decent money you should sign up for this instead because otherwise you are taking away a slot from someone who needs it more financially.
