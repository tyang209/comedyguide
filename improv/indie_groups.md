## Making A Practice Group

First check out this very useful [guide](http://boards.ucbcomedy.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=35211) on the UCB Forums.

Make a practice group. It's easy to be part of a practice group if **YOU** make it happen. You already have the emails of people you like from 101-401. Email a bunch of them and try to get ~10 total people who are interested. Some will drop out and then you'll hopefully have around 8.
Now all you have to do is...

### Find a space!
ImprovCoaches has a nice [list](http://www.improvcoaches.com/spaces) of rehearsal studios in Manhattan. I personally like:
* Champions
* Ripley Grier
* Studio 150
* Cap21 (on weekends they are 50% off)

Expect to pay around $18-$25 an hour for a room. Don't get one that's too tiny. For reference, a UCB classroom is usually somewhere around 20' X 20'. 

### Find a coach!
Find a good coach. Ask your friends who they would recommend. Look for one on [ImprovCoaches](http://www.improvcoaches.com/coaches) and see who is free. There are also TONS of very good, very experienced coaches who are not or never were on a house team at UCB like [this guy :)](http://www.improvcoaches.com/coaches/tao-yang). 

### Doing Independent Shows?

After a few weeks or months, your practice group will wittle itself down to a group of dedicated, improv nerds and you'll want to start doing shows. Awesome! Time to book a show!

Troll Facebook! Make a post. Go to other people's indie shows. Be nice! Laugh. Talk to the hosts after the show and ask if they're booking teams. Here's a secret: booking teams is a lot of repetitive work. It always helps to ask and they'll likely book you. ESPECIALLY if your team is dedicated and you actually all show up to the show.

If I book you for a show I am hosting and your team is billed as having 7 people and all 7 of you show up I will love your team.

Here's a list of Facebook groups you could ask if anyone is booking teams.

[New York Improv Performance or Rehearsal Opportunities](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nycimprov/?ref=group_browse_new)

	Look for people posting performance opportunities at their shows.

[UCB Diversity Program and Friends](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DiversityFriends/?ref=group_browse_new)

	Post in here if you have a diverse team.

[NYC Improv/Standup/Sketch Resource](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1489427164653422/?ref=group_browse_new)
	
	Big giant comedy FB Group. You might get lost in the noise here but worth checking out.


### Host a show!

If you can't find a show, then host a show! There are some venues that already have a ton of comedys hows going on, but you would be doing the entire improv scene a favor if you found a **NEW ONE.**

**Where the venues at?**
* [TripleCrown](http://triplecrownnyc.com)
	
	Where everyone starts. Don't listen to people shit on this venue. It's a good venue. Great shows happen here if you make them happen. Bad shows happen if you don't care. I don't know the contact info with their new website. Ask Steve Ling if you wanna do a show.
* [Legion Bar](http://www.legion-bar.com/)
	
	My favorite indie venue. It's off the Graham L stop so it's not in Manhattan but it's very close. It's got a private back room that's secluded from the bar.
* [Muchmores](http://muchmoresnyc.com/)
	
	Another indie Brooklyn venue. Contact them for booking a slot. It's a huge room but a tiny stage. I suggest doing improv on the floor and not on the stage and moving the couches.
* [The PIT Loft](https://thepit-nyc.com/pit-loft/)
	
	Technically it's run by the PIT but you can run a show there if you inquire. It's more legitimate than the other ones but still free. You're going to be more legit and expected to bring real audiences who buy drinks. The Arististic Director of the PIT will evaluate your show for future slots.

* [Under St. Marks](http://www.horsetrade.info/under-st-marks)
	
	Whoa slow down there bucko. This place costs a ton of money. I'm talking hundreds to do a show. You gotta graduate to Under St. Marks. Very experienced teams like [Thank You Robot](http://thankyourobot.improvteams.com/) do monthly shows here. Reach out to teams like that to book a show.

**How do we host a show?**

Typically:
* Book 2-3 other teams. You can have a long show but honestly more than 4 improv sets in a row and people will get tired.
* Give each team around ~15 minutes if you can. Twenty if you got the time.
* Book someone to do characters or standup to break it up.
* Host the show with some energy. 
* Figure out the tech and stuff beforehand.
